# Question-About-FLTrust

Hi, since you didn't leave an email on your profile, I'm transferring this repo to just catch your notice.

I have a question regarding your FLTrust_pytorch. If I run the command below: 
```
python FLTrustServer.py -nc 100 -cf 0.1 -E 5 -B 10 -mn mnist_cnn -ncomm 1000 -iid 0 -lr 0.01 -vf 10 -g 0
```
The central model and all the client models have nan parameters after around 150 communications. I wonder if it is gradient explosion. Do you know how to fix it?

Please contact me via email: boyuan.chen@nyu.edu

Thanks!
